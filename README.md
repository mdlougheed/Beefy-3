# Meaty-3
A USB-Serial adapter with selectable RTS-CTS outputs and high power 3.3V regulator (Based on Sparkfun Beefy-3)

Adapted and designed for projects needing more power (up to 1 Amp) using the FTDI 6-Pin signal layout.  Configurable RTS-CTS output allows automatic program reset for development boards using RTS (Arduino, Lilypad, etc) or CTS crossover (NodeMCU, ESP8266, ESP-01, Huzzah).
